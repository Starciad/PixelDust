Sandbox project ("Project"). This agreement is designed to protect 
both you as the Contributor and Starciad, ensuring that 
Contributions are integrated in compliance with the relevant 
intellectual property laws.

legal entity making the Contribution.

  "Contribution" means any original work of authorship, 
including modifications or additions to existing work, that is

You or another entity alleging that Your Contribution infringes a 
patent, any patent licenses granted to that entity for Your 
Contribution under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date

object to derogatory treatments of Your Contributions.

  5. Representations and Warranties

  By submitting a Contribution, You represent that:

  - You are the original author of the Contribution or have 
sufficient rights to grant the licenses described in this 
Agreement.

  If the Contribution was created in the course of employment, You 
represent that Your employer has authorized You to submit the 
Contribution on its behalf or has waived any applicable rights 
over the Contribution.

  You have disclosed any third-party content or intellectual 
property rights associated with Your Contribution and have 
ensured that any third-party content used is appropriately 
licensed and disclosed.

  6. Third-Party Content and Rights

  If Your Contribution includes content or works not authored by You 
("Third-Party Content") or if Your Contribution incorporates 
third-party intellectual property rights ("Third-Party Rights"), 
You must include a clear description of such content and rights. 
This includes identification of the author or owner of the 
Third-Party Content, where it was obtained, and any applicable 
license terms.

  Unless required by applicable law or agreed upon in writing, You 
provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties
