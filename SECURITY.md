# Security Policy

Stardust Sandbox is a collaborative public project that grows and evolves slowly; developers and supporters strive to ensure security and efficiency in using this package, and this is not possible without constant regulation of the project. Sometimes, small things can become significant, and in these cases, it's always good to report to us!

## `1.` I Found a Bug

If you've reviewed the code and found any part that could be vulnerable to your application, impact performance, or have other adverse effects on your application, it is extremely important to report it as a security issue. Open an issue reporting the problem you found, and in a few moments (or more), your issue will be prioritized and gradually fixed until there are no more problems!

Your help is extremely important for quick and practical evolution, as YOU are the one who will develop and use your applications, and feedback on what can be improved is extremely important. That said, do not hesitate to report issues or things that can be improved.

## `2.` Related Matters

For better management, add the respective tags that cover your issue, and in your question, clearly state the obstacle in your project. Your collaboration is extremely important.
