# Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Stardust Sandbox Code of Conduct. This document contains important information on how you (along with the community) should conduct yourself during the development and interaction with the game.

## `1.` Our Commitment

We, as members, contributors, and administrators, are committed to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, national origin, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## `2.` Our Standards

To ensure everything is tolerated correctly and friendly, here's a small list of how to behave during any type of interaction throughout the project.

1. Demonstrate empathy and kindness towards others;
1. Respect different opinions, points of view, and experiences;
1. Please give and accept constructive feedback;
1. Respect fellow members and avoid creating conflicts.

## `3.` General Rules

Below is a list of rules that may result in future punishments for sinners who commit them. Pay attention to the project's imposed limits to avoid loopholes for punishments:

1. The use of violent language or indirectly/extremely sexualized images and attention or advances of any sexual nature to any community member;
1. Insulting, harassing, or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks;
1. Public or private harassment;
1. Posting private information about other people, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit permission;

## `4.` Administration

Administrators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take corrective actions respectfully and fairly in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. They also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not covered by this Code of Conduct and to communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## `5.` Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and also when an individual officially represents the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posts on an official social media account, or acting as a named representative in an online or offline event.

## `6.` Enforcement Guidelines

Administrators will follow these Community Impact Guidelines when determining the consequences of any action they deem to violate this Code of Conduct. The level of punishment for each offense committed will depend on the context and development of events, after which a small meeting will be held to decide the best punishment for such an act.
