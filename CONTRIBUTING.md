Feel free to contribute with whatever you find most relevant and interesting, whether in the game itself or other specific aspects.

The purpose of this document is to provide you with a general overview of the different ways you can contribute to the project. Each section has its own unique details and important information, so please read carefully before officially contributing.

## 3. Best Practices

### 3.1. Descriptive Titles

Use concise and descriptive titles in issues or PRs. Detailed information should be provided in the description.

### 3.2. Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard. Each commit should clearly describe the change and reference open issues using the `#` symbol.

**Examples of good commit messages:**

- `refactor: Refactor code for the 5th entity`;  
- `feat: Add new GUI component`.

**Examples of incorrect commit messages:**

- `Tit and tat`;  
- `Fixed`;  
- `Oops`.

### 3.3. Pull Request

When contributing and creating a PR, provide clear and informative documentation. This increases the likelihood of a successful integration.

## 4. Code Review

Each PR is carefully reviewed. If your PR is rejected, a detailed justification will be provided. We appreciate the time and effort you dedicate to Stardust Sandbox. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the team or the community.
